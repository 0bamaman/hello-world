Hello GitHub!

My name is Cole Sheyka and I am a mechanical engineering student at CU Boulder. I have had the previous goal of paying for my education with crypto investments, but the market collapsed and I lost 50% of my portfolio value! Momentarily, this will not pay for my education. I work part-time at The Home Depot as a student, so my income is linear and my rate of earnings is low. This will not stop me from getting my degree! Hence, I have downloaded GitHub in efforts to create my own token or coin that I can invest in.

My goal is to help out my family, friends, and anyone else who reads this message. I am a novice programmer (fresh out of a basic C+ coding class with Arduino), but I believe I understand the dicipline it takes to become successful in a project like this. As of the time of this writing, I have only spent about 20 hours thinking and reaserching ways to create a decentralized currency. These are my first few minutes communicating in this fashion.
